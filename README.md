# 🌿 basil

basil is an intelligent recipe generation app that helps you make the most of your food inventory. It prioritizes ingredients that are about to expire, allows you to specify your mealtime preferences, and generates customized recipes based on what you have on hand.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Inventory Management:** Track your groceries and their expiration dates
- **Intelligent Recipe Generation:** AI-powered suggestions based on what you have on hand
- **Expiration Prioritization:** Recipes that use items that will expire soon
- **Customized Meal Planning:** Specify preferences from quick 15-minute lunches to 4-course dinners
- **Nutrition Tracking:** Get detailed nutritional information for recipes
- **Secure Authentication:** Amazon Cognito integration for user management

## 🔧 Technologies

### Frontend
- **React 19** with Router for single-page application architecture
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **AWS Amplify & Cognito** for user authentication
- **Marked** for markdown parsing of recipe content

### Backend
- **Flask** serving a RESTful API
- **SQLite** with **SQLAlchemy** ORM for database operations
- **Python 3** with modern async patterns
- **Gunicorn** for production deployment

### AI Integration
- **Custom AI Client** with **Mosaic/OpenAI** for recipe generation
- **Structured JSON Response Parsing** for consistent nutrition data
- **USDA Food Database** integration for accurate nutrition information
- **Smart prompting system** to enforce JSON-formatted nutritional outputs

## 🏗️ Architecture

basil is built as a full-stack application with:

1. **React Frontend:** Modern React application with component-based architecture, routing, and state management
2. **Flask Backend API:** RESTful API with endpoints for food inventory, favorites, recipe generation, and AI integration
3. **SQLite Database:** Efficiently stores user data, food inventory, nutrition facts, and favorite recipes
4. **AI Integration Layer:** Custom Mosaic/OpenAI client with carefully crafted prompts for recipe generation
5. **USDA Data Layer:** Processes millions of USDA food data points for accurate nutritional information

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-with-flask
   ```

2. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd api
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a .env file in the project root with your API keys**
   ```
   OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
   ```

### Running the Development Environment

1. **Start the Flask API server**
   ```bash
   npm run api
   ```

2. **Start the React development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

## 🌟 Key Features in Detail

### Smart Expiration Management
basil uses intelligent algorithms to calculate expiration dates based on food type:
- Very perishable items (lettuce, berries, fish): 1-3 days
- Short-term perishables (broccoli, milk, fresh meat): 3-7 days
- Medium-term items (apples, cheese, eggs): 1-2 weeks
- Long-term items (potatoes, whole grain bread): 3-4 weeks
- Pantry items (rice, pasta, canned goods): 6+ months

### AI-Powered Recipe Generation
The AI system considers:
- Available ingredients in your inventory
- Items approaching expiration (prioritized)
- Your specified meal preferences and time constraints
- Nutritional balance and dietary requirements
- Realistic preparation methods and techniques

### USDA Integration
Direct integration with USDA food database provides:
- Accurate nutritional information for thousands of foods
- Standardized serving sizes and measurements
- Comprehensive macro and micronutrient data
- Support for both branded and generic food items

## 🛠️ Development Challenges

- **Data Processing:** Converting millions of data points from USDA CSV files into a queryable SQLite database format
- **API Security:** Implementing secure Mosaic/OpenAI client integration while protecting API keys
- **AI Consistency:** Extensive testing with different models and prompts to achieve consistent, accurate recipe outputs
- **User Experience:** Creating an intuitive interface accessible to users regardless of technical expertise
- **Real-time Features:** Implementing responsive inventory management and recipe generation
